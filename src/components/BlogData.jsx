        para: `<p>San Francisco: Google is working on a Pinterest-like app called Keen that will let people collect and share ideas, links and resources.</p>
        <p>Keen which is a web and Android app encourages users to make a "Keen" (like a Pinterest board) about any topic they like.</p>
        <p>"On Keen, you say what you want to spend more time on, and then curate content from the web and people you trust to help make that happen," said CJ Adams, Co-founder, Keen.</p>
        <p>Keen is part of Area 120, Google's workshop for experimental projects.</p>
        <p>People make a "keen," which can be about any topic, whether it's baking delicious bread at home, getting into birding or researching typography.</p>
        <p>"Keen lets you curate the content you love, share your collection with others and find new content based on what you have saved," Adams said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Users can add links, photos and other resources, invite friends to collaborate and follow "Keens" they find interesting.</p>
        <p>The Keen team worked in close collaboration with another team at Google called People and AI Research (PAIR), dedicated to human-centered machine learning systems.</p>
        <p>You can curate 'Keen' yourself or for other people. The keens can be private or public, so you control what is shared and who can contribute.</p>
        <p>"For every keen you create, we use Google Search and the latest in machine learning to remain on the lookout for helpful content related to your interests," informed Adams.</p>
        <p>Even if you're not an expert on a topic, you can start curating a keen and save a few interesting "gems" or links that you find helpful.</p>
        <p>People can also follow keens that others have created, discovering thousands of hand-curated lists from the community and getting alerts when new things are added.</p>
        <p>"Keen isn't intended to be a place to spend endless hours browsing. Instead, it's a home for your interests: a place to grow them, share them with loved ones," said Google.</p>`

        para: `<p>NEW DELHI: The third episode of 'Moon Knight' ended with Konshu being imprisoned in stone thanks to his manipulation of the night sky. Meanwhile, Marc and Steven are left without powers and without access to the Moon Knight suit.</p>
        <p>Steve refuses to let Marc be back in control of their body, which presents him and Layla with problems. The show has yet to officially diagnose Marc, though references to him being unwell have been made and the obvious presence of at least one alter personality.</p>
        <p>In the climax of the episode, Layla and Steven are being hunted by Arthur and his men in the long-lost tomb of Alexander the Great. Steven lets Marc out briefly, only for him to be shot by Arthur and to fall, dramatically, into a pool of water.</p>
        <p>When he wakes, Marc is near catatonic, strapped to a wheelchair in a brightly lit, white room in a mental hospital. A fellow unnamed patient approaches, and as Marc looks up at her we see it is in fact Layla. Also there is Donna, Steven's boss from the British Museum and Arthur Harrow.</p>
        <iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"  src="https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?id=1516687665126641667&amp;" data-tweet-id="1516687665126641667" style="max-width: 550px; height: 624px; width: calc(100% - 2px); display: block; margin: 10px auto; min-width: 226px; padding: 0px;"></iframe>
        <p>However, he isn't Arthur Harrow, but Marc's psychologist. Marc is in a mental hospital, presumably for his dissociative identity disorder. Heavily sedated, Marc glances around the office and sees Arthur in sandals, as well as the familiar cane. There are also Egyptian statues all over the office, and a drawing of Khonshu himself.</p>
        <p>The doctor approaches Marc and tells him that the high dosage of medication has been given because of his destructive behaviour and refusal to admit that he is sick and needs help.</p>
        <p>The way the show has begun to bend reality is finally tantalising for audiences. Right from the beginning, the series hinted that the lead character himself is not aware of his own actions and what is happening around him. However, this remains the most intriguing episode of Marvel’s Moon Knight so far.</p>
        <p>Directed by Mohamed Diab, Moon Knight is streaming on Disney+, with new episodes airing every Wednesday.</p>`

        para: `<p>Travelling around the world is a dream for many of us and we all have our reasons for it. Some say that it's a kind of meditation for them while some want to explore the culture of different places. For some, travel is a source of happiness and for some, it’s a break from their otherwise monotonous life. Whatever your reason might be, we should travel as much as possible because of the contribution it does to our overall personality development.</p>
        <p>Essentially, two factors are required for travelling, and those are time and money.</p>
        <p>Normally, people earn money, do some savings, and then travel using that money. Some people do freelancing work like digital marketing, website development, etc, and fund their travel. But nowadays, we see a different kind of a trend where some people claim to travel without money. We see a lot of such posts on social media, in which people ask for help in providing them with food or accommodation as they are travelling without any money. There are a lot of content creators on YouTube who make videos about travelling and show how they managed to travel with either no money or very minimum money by relying on hitchhiking and other people for food and accommodation. And what surprises me the most is the glorification that these posts receive from a very large number of people, appreciating the daring they show.</p>
        <p>Here, I would like to specify that I hold nothing against anyone who is doing it or promoting it. They are free to lead the kind of life they want. But wasn’t it always the case, No Money= No Travel. My problem is with this trend of relying on others to bear the cost of your travel. In a way, it’s a kind of begging, just that you are doing it for travelling while a very large percentage of the population does it for basic survival. If you are so passionate about travel, work for it and spend your own money on it.</p>
        <p>Some people would come up with an excuse that they want to travel but don’t have money. To them, I would say that they should first focus on building their career and then travel with the money they earn. If your financial condition is not good, it is your responsibility to improve it first before you think about anything else.</p>
        <p>But the question is that, isn’t hitchhiking a kind of begging? If you are in a situation where you are not finding any transportation facility due to some unforeseen circumstances and you ask for help, then it is not begging. However, if you are doing it just to save money on your trip, then yes, it is begging. You knew that you would be travelling from place A to place B and you could have planned for paid transportation, be it private or public. But instead, you chose to stand by the side of the road, with a placard in your hand, asking for a free ride.</p>
        <p>What about free food and accommodation? If you are relying on others for your food and accommodation while you want to travel around, you are begging just like someone who is begging for basic survival needs. The only difference is that they are asking for it directly and you are asking for it subtly. Some people would say that we do couch surfing, or we stay with local people just to experience their culture. I would say that if you want to do that, you can stay in a homestay and pay for it. Or if you want to stay with some local family and think that the host might get offended if you offer money to them, give them some gift as a token of gratitude.</p>
        <p>I often see people posting about volunteering for food or accommodation. It’s a wonderful thing to do if you are doing it to support some cause. If you are doing it to sustain your travel, it is still acceptable as you are doing some work for your food or accommodation or whatever you get in return. But be very careful if you are doing it in some foreign country and check the rules beforehand. Normally, you are not allowed to work for remuneration when you are on a tourist visa and it might land you in trouble.</p>
        <p>Some trends are not supposed to be followed and this one is surely bad. Think about a scenario when a lot of people get inspired by these no money travellers and start travelling like this. When you travel to someplace and spend money over there, you contribute towards the economy of that place. But if you are not spending anything, you are just a burden for the place and its economy.</p>
        <p>If you don’t have money, earn it. If you have less money, travel on a budget by using public transportation, stay in hostels/homestays, and eat in dhabas or roadside stalls. A lot of information about low coast travel options is available on the internet. Do thorough research and make a travel plan that suits your budget.</p>
        <p>What's the point of travelling when you have to constantly worry about your next meal and where are going to stay next?</p>`

        para: `<p>New Delhi: Ganesh Utsav has finally arrived and with pandals ready to welcome devotees, awe-inspiring Ganesh idols ready to be worshipped and lively dance and music adding to the fervour, it is evident that the festive season has truly begun. Out of all the preparations, Modaks top the list of every devotee so make sure you are trying out new options this time.</p>
        <p>Yogesh Ghorpade, founder and CEO, Uplodefoodie, and Kashmiri Nath, an expert at Momspresso, give some exciting Modak recipes that you can prepare to satiate your sweet tooth while enjoying different festivities:</p>
        <p>* Chana dal Modak: It is made with rice flour and wheat flour loaded with cooked chana dal and some jaggery blended with it. Cook chana dal, take half cup chopped jaggery and one-fourth cup of water in another pan, cook and stir it well so the jaggery melts. Then mix the jaggery syrup with the mashed chana dal and add grated coconut. Boil some water and add the rice flour and keep stirring it for three to four minutes. Mix it with the dough and finish it by making small balls. Steam them in a pan and garnish with the rose petals.</p>
        <p>* Chocolate Modak: A modern take on a traditional Indian sweet, chocolate Modak is an excellent new addition loved by both kids and adults. To make this, start by mixing 50 ml milk and half a can of condensed milk in a pan over medium heat. As soon as it begins to boil, turn off the heat and add 275 gm of chocolate chips into the pan and keep stirring until all of it melts. Turn on the heat and cook the mixture over a low flame. As soon as it begins to thicken, add one cup of powdered digestive biscuits and stir till it forms a dough. You can also add chopped pistachios to give it a nutty twist. Let the mixture cool, and then start shaping them into Modaks. Garnish with chocolate chips and roasted pistachios.</p>
        <p>* Mawa Modak: The mouth-watering Mawa Modaks are made of khoya, powdered sugar, dried figs and nutties. Stir khoya and powdered sugar in a pan till it starts to melt. Let it cool and add the powdered nutties like cashews, almonds, coconut and chopped figs into it. Make its shape with Modak mould. Put the small ball in the mould, add stuffing mixture and press it so it seals properly. Open the seal, remove and shape them likewise.</p>
        <p>* Malai Modak: These are prepared with paneer, condensed milk and Kesar. Crush the paneer into small pieces and put it in a pan, add condensed milk in it. Keep stirring it so the paneer granules are mashed properly. Cook for 7-8 minutes till it becomes like a dough. Then take it out in a plate and let the dough cool down. Grease the mould with ghee and start shaping them. Your Modak is ready.</p>`

        para: `<p>Santa Monica is a city so rich in history, culture, and activity that there are tons of quirky facts about it that even locals might not know! Here’s a list of some of the more eccentric and less recognized information about beautiful, sunny Santa Monica.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: 600;">Beach backstories</p>
        <p>Did you know that Elzie Crisler Segar created the Popeye comic in Santa Monica in 1919? Legend has it that when Segar was living in Santa Monica, he befriended Olaf Olsen, a Norwegian sailor he met on the Santa Monica Pier. It’s believed that Olsen was the real-life inspiration for the famous comic book character Popeye. However, whether or not Olsen ate a lot of spinach is still a topic up for debate.</p>
        <p>Santa Monica is also home to the Dogtown Movement of extreme skateboarders (immortalized in the documentary “Dogtown and Z-Boys”). While the influential Z-Boys were initially surfers, the group began skateboarding to practice their board moves. They quickly became full-time skaters and were constantly spotted on their boards throughout the city. It’s because of them that skateboarding went from a local hobby to a nationwide pastime.</p>
        <p>While indoor volleyball originated in 1895, people in Santa Monica decided to take the sport outdoors in the early 1900s and thus beach volleyball was born. Nets and courts began popping up on beaches along the Pacific Ocean and the sport soon became immensely popular, especially during the Great Depression. Today, beach volleyball is played by millions of people and is a mainstay of the Summer Olympics.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: 600;">Eco-friendly facts</p>
        <p>Los Angeles and Santa Monica pride themselves on being extremely eco-friendly. It’s no surprise that the first solar-powered Ferris wheel is located on the Santa Monica Pier at Pacific Park. The wheel made its debut spin-in 1996 and has since been redesigned to feature 174,000 LED lights. The ride is so green that it even goes dark every year to celebrate Earth Hour.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: 600;">Tech Trivia</p>
        <p>It’s no secret that Northern California is home to Silicon Valley. But, few people know that Southern California has its very own version of a tech territory. Down here, it’s called Silicon Beach and it’s in Santa Monica where such start-up companies as YouTube, Hulu, Tinder, and Headspace have all set up shop. Other tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Yahoo have since opened satellite offices nearby. Because, seriously, nothing can be more inspiring when creating innovative technological advances than being so close to the beach!</p>
        <p>While Silicon Beach is still a relatively new area of industry for Santa Monica, the video game world has been here for a long time. Giant gaming companies like Activision, Playstation, Naughty Dog, and Treyarch are all headquartered in the city by the sea. This means games like Call of Duty, Guitar Hero, the Tony Hawk’s series, and Star Citizen were all created in Santa Monica.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: 600;">Architectural attractions</p>
        <p>You might be familiar with the Aero Theatre that sits pretty on Montana Avenue. With double-feature events as well as classic film showings, the theater is a Santa Monica landmark. But, did you know that it was originally built in 1939 to be a 24-hour continuous movie theatre for the aircraft workers who worked shifts around the clock at a nearby facility? Laborers were working double time for the war effort so, as a break, they could stop by the Aero and take in the newest Hollywood fare.</p>
        <p>Located on Ocean Avenue is a six-acre urban oasis known as Tongva Park designed by architect extraordinaire James Corner, the brains behind the creation of New York’s High Line Park. Tongva Park features an amphitheatre, fountains, a playground, and plenty of picnic areas that both locals and visitors love. The stunning views of the Pacific aren’t too shabby either.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: 600;">Undiscovered Talents</p>
        <p>Last but not least, Santa Monica is making its name in the art world. The beach city currently has the second largest collection of galleries per square foot in America (after New York City). From the Bergamot Station, which houses 30 galleries, to the Santa Monica Art Studios, which is a 22,000 square-foot hangar featuring Arena 1 gallery, Santa Monica is a true hub for art.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: 600;">Famous Faces</p>
        <p>A number of notable people call Santa Monica their birth city. They include legendary child actress Shirley Temple, the funny man Jack Black, Academy Award winner Anjelica Huston, original Spider-Man Tobey Maguire and activist Jamie Lee Curtis.</p>`

        para: `<p>New Delhi: All the movie buffs, add Gerald Butler and Morena Baccarin’s starrer ‘Greenland’ to your watchlist. After the runaway global success of Gerald Butler's Greenland, the movie is all set to release in Hindi, Tamil and English exclusively on Lionsgate Play on 15th April, 2022, we decided to give you a small synopsis of the film.</p>
        <p>It’s time to embrace an alternate reality where a comet races to Earth to destroy the race of humanity. Gerald Butler takes the centre stage as John Garrity who is separated from his wife and son. John must find a way to save them from the approaching apocalypse that will doom the entire humanity.</p>
        <p><b><i>Here are five reasons why you must watch Greenland this weekend:</i></b></p>
        <p>Gerlad Butler steals the show with his heart-wrenching performance in ‘Greenland’. The actor successfully balanced out action sequences and also at the same time brought out the humane side of John, thus rendering the story credible enough to keep viewers hooked to their screens.</p>
        <p style="color: red";>Gripping storyline</p>
        <p>Greenland revolves around the story of a family making an arduous journey through dreadful catastrophe, as they cling to the hope for survival in the catastrophic times. The movie will keep you gripped until the last second.</p>
        <p style="color: red";>Adrenaline inducing action sequences</p>
        <p>Fiery edge-of-the-seat action elements like exploding planes, and torched cities make Greenland a visual delight. Director Ric Roman Waugh and screenwriter Chris Sparling envisioned the film's action sequences in ever-increasing waves of fury, starting relatively small and then pulling out the big guns in the final act that left viewers wanting for more.</p>
        <p style="color: red";>Emotional rollercoaster narrative</p>
        <p>Greenland promises to emotionally engage you with its story. The film includes a realistic portrayal of human nature in the face of danger that captures the core of Gerald Butler’s character instead of portraying him as a ‘regular man with superpowers’.</p>
        <p style="color: red";>Alas, our favourite - Hopeful Ending!</p>
        <p>While the ending of Greenland leaves the fates of the Garritys and the rest of humanity in a very uncertain place, Director Waugh in one of his interviews said he’s ultimately optimistic that humankind could prevail even in the most unimaginable circumstances and with Greenland he intends on providing viewers with that sense of hope.</p>`

        para: `<p>New Delhi: To loosen up and de-stress, millennials have understood that travelling is the best therapy. Utilising long weekends, Indians are exploring more offbeat locations rather than going to another city with the same hustle bustle, say experts.</p>
        <p>Dhruv Raj Gupta, Founder and CEO, TripShelf and Dhruv Sharma, CEO and Founder of GuestHouser, have listed few travel trends this year:</p>
        <p>* Staycation is in: Staycation or staying in the same city has undergone a very interesting paradigm shift due to over-tourism. Travellers are increasingly seeking out relaxed, luxury stays at holiday homes around them in the same city. </p>
        <p>* Choosing home stays over hotels: A growing population of well-travelled urban millennials has grown tired of conventional tourism; which focuses on the simple historical sightseeing and standardized hotel rooms.</p>
        <p>This population is looking for something more personal and unique wherein they can take a dip in an unfamiliar culture, and experience it by living with a native family. They also look forward to eating authentic food of the place they're visiting and home stays thus prove to be a good option.</p>
        <p>* Exotic or offbeat destinations: Stress busting and exploring unexplored places are the two top reasons for travel on long weekends amongst millennials instead of catching up with friends, research or writing.</p>
        <p>From quaint solo getaways to off-season mountain escapes and immersive adventures, urban millennials are not nervous about trying unexplored places. They prefer short backpacking trips with just 2-3 nights to stay, and don't mind taking overnight buses or road trips to destinations within a distance of 400 km from Delhi.</p>
        <p>* Last minute travel: With the upswing of various online portals and last-minute attractive deals, spontaneous trips are trending among millennials and they don't hesitate in making plans on the go. Bookings are made less than 24 hours before the trip to various off beat locations.</p>
        <p>* Solo travel on an all-time high: With an all-time high number of people travelling solo, the travel industry has completely transformed to enrich the experience of young solo explorers. These young travellers engage in enriching experiences, learning new skills, immerse themselves in culture while they are out there exploring.</p>
        <p>The solo excursion helps in a personalized experience that is curated based on individual likes and preferences.</p>
        <p>* Wellness retreat: As people are taking care of their mental health and are paying it equal attention to as their physical health, wellness trips are taking a huge hike. The goal is to be more mentally sound and relaxed before returning to the routine life.</p>
        <p>Activities like yoga, meditation, hiking, surfing, long treks or even running are the focus of such trips to reduce stress. Various places like Rishikesh, Gokarna, Coimbatore and Mysore have amazing wellness retreats.</p>`

        para: `<p>Melbourne: Film studio Warner Bros says it has "complied" with Chinese censors to edit out specific references to a gay relationship in "Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore", its latest theatrical release in the country.</p>
        <p>According to Australian website news.Com.Au, the Chinese version has chopped six seconds from the film's final cut, including two lines of dialogues that referenced a previous romantic relationship between lead characters, Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald, played by Jude Law and Mads Mikkelsen, in the movie.</p>
        <p>The lines in question were, "because I was in love with you" and "the summer Gellert and I fell in love".</p>
        <p>"The Secrets of Dumbledore" is the third film in the "Fantastic Beasts" series, a prequel spin-off in the popular "Harry Potter" franchise based on the book series by J K Rowling.</p>
        <p>Also starring Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Ezra Miller, Alison Sudol, Dan Fogler, Callum Turner, and Jessica Williams, the film was released in China on April 8. Warner Bros said the spirit of the movie remains "intact" despite the cuts.</p>
        <p>"As a studio, we're committed to safeguarding the integrity of every film we release, and that extends to circumstances that necessitate making nuanced cuts in order to respond sensitively to a variety of in-market factors.</p>
        <p>"Our hope is to release our features worldwide as released by their creators but historically we have faced small edits made in local markets. In the case of Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, a six-second cut was requested and Warner Bros accepted those changes to comply with local requirements but the spirit of the film remains intact," the studio said in a statement to the web portal.</p>
        <p>The company said they want the audiences, including in China, to enjoy the film.</p>
        <p>"We want audiences everywhere in the world to see and enjoy this film, and it's important to us that Chinese audiences have the opportunity to experience it as well, even with these minor edits," Warner Bros further said in the statement.</p>
        <p>In 2007, Rowling announced that Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, is gay and that he and Grindelwald had an affair when they were young.</p>
        <p>The English author made the remarks following the publication of the seventh and final "Harry Potter" book, "The Deathly Hallows". Dumbledore was not explicitly gay in the book series.</p>
        <p>"The Secrets of Dumbledore" officially acknowledged the character's sexuality on screen for the first time.</p>
        <p>Previously, "Bohemian Rhapsody", the Freddie Mercury biopic, was famously chopped by Chinese censors, omitting all references to the Queen frontman's sexuality.</p>
        <p>Even the best actor Oscars acceptance speech by Rami Malek, who played Mercury in the film, was altered on Chinese television when the subtitles replaced "gay man" with "special group".</p>`

        para: `<p>New Delhi: The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has responded to actor Will Smith's resignation, saying that it has accepted the resignation and will "continue to move forward" with disciplinary proceedings against him.</p>
        <p>David Rubin, President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in a statement, addressed the resignation and ongoing controversy.</p>
        <p>"We have received and accepted Mr Will Smith's immediate resignation from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences," said Rubin in a statement sent to People magazine.</p>
        <p>Rubin added, "We will continue to move forward with our disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Smith for violations of the Academy's Standards of Conduct, in advance of our next scheduled board meeting on April 18."</p>
        <p>The statement came in response to Smith announcing his resignation after he slapped comedian Chris Rock at the 94th Academy Awards on Sunday. "I have directly responded to the Academy's disciplinary hearing notice, and I will fully accept any and all consequences for my conduct. My actions at the 94th Academy Awards presentation were shocking, painful, and inexcusable," the actor said in a statement. He added, "The list of those I have hurt is long and includes Chris, his family, many of my dear friends and loved ones, all those in attendance, and global audiences at home. I betrayed the trust of the Academy."</p>
        <p>The actor further said, "I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken. I want to put the focus back on those who deserve attention for their achievements and allow the Academy to get back to the incredible work it does to support creativity and artistry in film. So, I am resigning from membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and will accept any further consequences the Board deems appropriate."</p>
        <p>Smith, who won his first Oscar this year for 'King Richard', concluded, "Change takes time and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason."The conflict arose after Rock, who was presenting the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature, seized the moment to crack a few jokes, including one about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head.</p>
        <p>He compared the 50-year-old actor's appearance to that of Demi Moore's look in 'G.I. Jane'.</p>
        <p>Jada, who recently opened up about living with alopecia areata, was visibly upset, rolling her eyes from her seat.Seconds later, Smith walked onstage and approached Rock, smacking him in front of the audience.</p>
        <p>The 53-year-old actor also shouted to a stunned Rock, "Keep my wife's name out of your f---ing mouth."</p>
        <p>Smith then remained seated with his wife at his table for the rest of the event. Rock has so far declined to press charges.</p>
        <p>When Smith won Best Actor later in the ceremony, he apologised to the Academy and his fellow nominees but didn't mention Rock by name.</p>
        <p>In his tearful speech, he spoke about acting out of love and protection, saying, "Love makes you do crazy things."</p>
        <p>The 'King Richard' actor went on to publicly apologise to Rock on social media the following day.</p>`

The movie is produced by Sajid Nadiadwala who has been very generous in terms of budget to make sure that the film is top-notch and a visual treat for the audiences. ‘Heropanti 2’ was shot at some exotic locations in England, India, Russia, Thailand, and Abu Dhabi and the biggest international action directors were roped in for the film.</p>
        <p>If that wasn’t all, according to an insider source, protagonist Tiger Shroff  had a massive budget allotted just for his looks and outfits in the film. The action star’s wardrobe became one of the key components on the overall budget as several of these designer suits from top brands were destroyed in the process of filming the high octane action sequences.</p>

        <p>Talking about the same a production source revealed, “Close to 45 to 50 suits from the biggest designer labels were purchased for Tiger Shroff, many of which were damaged as he was performing his stunts and filming action sequences in these expensive suits. The visuals are not just adrenaline packed but oozing of style and panache because Tiger looks like an international action star in every single frame thanks to the work that went into his looks.”</p>
        <p>This is Tiger Shroff, Sajid Nadiadwala and director Ahmed Khan’s third collaboration together after films like Baaghi 2 and Baaghi 3. This time around the sequel of the blockbuster has been mounted on a huge budget and will witness never-seen-before action.</p>

        para: `<p>Sun, surf, mountains, and roller coasters: The Golden State is big and beautiful, whether you want to play at the beach, ride your way across California theme parks, or camp at one of California’s national parks. The state’s size and variety of offerings mean that a California family vacation will call for some solid preparation.</p>
        <p>Here are 11 tips and family-friendly travel hacks to help you build your family’s trip, with an eye toward keeping the fun quotient high and missed opportunities to a minimum.</p>
        <p><b>1. Pack and dress in layers: </b>In Southern California, a sunny 70-degree day can feel like 80 or hotter to people from other parts of the country, while a cloudy 60-degree day can feel much chillier, thanks to ocean breezes. In Northern California—especially San Francisco—summer can mean a lot of morning fog and temperatures in the 50s that turn into warmer temps in the afternoon. All over the state, it’s a safe bet to dress in layers and keep a sweater, sweatshirt, or light jacket in your day pack.</p>
        <p><b>2. Don’t pack beach gear: </b>Your hotel may have toys and gear on hand to borrow or rent. You can also buy boogie boards—an easy-to-learn way to play in the surf—for as little as $10 at any drug store or discount store near the beach. That’s also a budget-friendly way to pick up sandcastle-making toys, sunscreen, hats, and flip-flops.</p>
        <p><b>3. Maximize your time at the theme parks: </b>Staying at one of the on-site hotels can get you early entry—usually an hour earlier than the scheduled opening time—but sometimes just buying your tickets online (like at Universal Studios Hollywood) can get you an extra hour with shorter lines. Also, check the park’s website for express-lane services (like Disneyland Resort’s Fastpasses) so that you can make the most of your time all day.</p>
        <p><b>4. Expect (some) admission discounts: </b>Kids and teens often get in free, or at a discount, at most museums and other attractions around the Golden State. San Diego has a "Kids Free October “program that is valid at many museums and other attractions, including SeaWorld and LEGOLAND. That said, don’t expect much of a break at other theme parks, or at other times. Full-price admission may start as low as age 10.</p>
        <p><b>5. Measure your kids: </b>Before you commit to a theme park for the day, check out the rides page on its website to see the height minimums, to make sure there are enough rides that your children will be able to enjoy. Also, get the lay of the land from the theme park’s online map, to plot your day’s path efficiently and delay the onset of tired feet.</p>
        <p><b>6. Book ahead for camping: </b>National parks such as Yosemite have well-established schedules for opening up campsites for reservations, and good spots can go fast—up to six months ahead of time. For last-minute spots, check a park’s campgrounds online to find availability.</p>
        <p><b>7. Don’t miss the Junior Ranger programs at state and national parks: </b>The free handouts and activities available at California national parks and state parks give kids a fun, hands-on way to explore the park. At Lassen Volcanic National Park, for instance, the activity booklet lists different hot springs and volcanic rocks for kids to look for and check off. At Antelope Valley California Poppy Preserve, meanwhile, a nature-oriented bingo card motivates kids to keep an eye out for lizards, meadowlarks, and beetles, as well as California’s state flower. Ask for any handouts at the park’s visitors centre.</p>
        <p><b>8.  Plan a ski trip that moves at everyone’s pace: </b>California ski resorts offer a wide range of age-specific lessons and activities—some with kids’ clubs that last half or full days, so that everyone gets plenty of time to ski or board at their own skill level. At Squaw Valley, for instance, about 65 percent of the trails are suitable for beginner and intermediate skiers, and Sierra-at-Tahoe has an 11-acre learning terrain called Easy Street. Off-the-slope activities abound as well, like Mammoth’s beloved Woolly’s Tube Park, or the 30-foot climbing wall at Big Bear and Snow Summit’s Basecamp. Meanwhile, even if your kids’ spring break falls as late as April, you’ll still find plenty of California snow.</p>
        <p><b>9. Bring lots of sun-screen: </b>Beach days certainly call for solid SPF, but you’ll also need sunscreen while skiing. California’s ski resorts are known for their wealth of bluebird snow days, which results in plenty of reflection off the slopes.</p>
        <p><b>10. Don’t assume that wine-tasting is off the table: </b>Not all wineries and craft breweries welcome kids, but many do—offering games, play areas, and kids’ dining menus so that the family can enjoy a visit together. Check the individual wineries’ or breweries’ websites before you go to make sure kids will be welcome and happily occupied.</p>
        <p><b>11. Don’t be afraid to take the kids to a nice dinner: </b>In California, cutting-edge restaurants are often not white-tablecloth–type places and many even have good kids’ menus—like the tamales and quesadillas at L.A.’s acclaimed Border Grill, or the prix fixe kids’ menu at San Francisco’s Rintaro, which Bon Appétit named one of the best restaurants of 2015. When in doubt, call ahead and ask when making a reservation; most hotels keep lists of reputable babysitting services at the front desk and can help you hire a great sitter to come to your hotel room.</p>`

        para: `<p>Gurugram: "Good food is good food, no matter where you eat it -- as long as the flavours are right." These golden words were spoken by Australian celebrity chef Sarah Todd, and they perfectly describe the delicious spread available at The Wine Company.</p>
        <p>Todd was here on a 'Meet and Greet' session at The Wine Company, which has pulled in the young and talented chef to curate its brand new menu on its fourth anniversary.</p>
        <p>Located in DLF Cyberhub, The Wine Company is a wine bar and restaurant which is popularising the concept of wine-dining in the Delhi-NCR region. This posh eatery features an in-house 'wine shop' where patrons can choose their preferred bottle of wine or any other spirit of their liking.</p>
        <p>"Wine doesn't need to be intimidating like people think it is. Wine can be fun. We want people not to feel overwhelmed and intimidated by what we are serving here; that is why I have added more Indian flavours to the menu so that I can show people that it is fine to drink wine and eat Indian food at the same time," Todd told IANS here.</p>
        <p>And true to her word, we did get a taste of what this Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef was talking about. We were first served the 'Frose', a frozen Rose wine slushie. It is a complimentary drink started exclusively by The Wine Company.</p>
        <p>The items that we had were some of Todd's signature dishes that included goat cheese churros, shitake and wombok momo, flambe Kashmiri kalari (a type of cheese very similar to the mozzarella), soft shell crab pakora with pomelo salad, citrus chilli prawns, Madras curried lamb tortellini, Kolhapuri slow-cooked lamb served on paan leaves, red wine duck kulcha, Goan pork sausage bhut jolokia risotto and, for dessert, a piece of lamington (Australia's favourite cake) with a scoop of coconut ice cream.</p>
        <p>All the dishes were paired with a different wine to further enhance the flavours.</p>
        <p>Everything that we ate was light, a perfect blend of Western and Indian influences. Some of the dishes that really stood out were the Madras curried lamb tortellini, Kolhapuri slow cooked lamb, red wine duck kulcha and the Goan pork Sausage bhut jolokia risotto.</p>
        <p>The burst of flavours with every bite seemed like a party in the mouth. Who would have thought that a tortellini could have a filling of South Indian flavoured lamb or eating paan like a taco with meat or serving duck meat on a kulcha or even the world's spiciest chilli added to a risotto? This is taking fusion food to a rarified level.</p>
        <p>"Often, in India, people think that dishes are being Indianised. But every dish that I have prepared here, I would also put on a menu in Australia. Because it is important to realise that no matter where you serve it, food needs to be tasty," Todd said.</p>
        <p>On infusing Indian influences into Western dishes like the tortellini, Todd said that adding the right flavour was the key.</p>
        <p>"As a chef, I'd like to add an extra bit of something to make the food even more palatable, even more alive -- so much so that even my seven-year-old son, who has an immature palate, loves it."</p>
        <p>For ideas, this chef visits people's homes.</p>
        <p>"I don't go to restaurants for inspiration, I go to homes. Whenever I travel to India I only go to homes. I want to get the authentic flavours from home-cooked food and bring those influences in my menu," the young chef said while talking about creating a dish like the Goan pork Sausage bhut jolokia risotto.</p>
        <p>Todd also owns a casual fine dining restaurant and beach club called the Antares Restaurant & Beach Club in Small Vagator Beach, Goa. Two years ago, she opened The Wine Rack in Mumbai which houses over 300 different kinds of wine.</p>
        <p>Calling the Indian palate as one of the most advanced, Todd said people in this country were evolving in terms of food preferences.</p>
        <p>"I've been in India for four years now and I'd have to say that there's been a major change. We received flak for some of the items in our Goa menu when we had just started, but now people love them... People are open to trying new things and are open to it as long as the flavour is there and the food is tasty," she added.</p>`

        para: `<p>Washington: A new trailer for Hollywood star Tom Cruise's much-anticipated movie Top Gun: Maverick has been unveiled on Tuesday and it shows the actor reviving his iconic role of Captain Pete Maverick Mitchell, now a high-flying test pilot and instructor. The film is a sequel to the 1986 hit movie Top Gun and has all the elements -- thrill, drama and action to keep the moviegoers glued to the screens.</p>
        <p>The sequel is set decades after the 1986 movie and features actor Miles Teller as the son of Anthony Edward's pilot Goose, who is killed during a training exercise in the first movie. The new trailer introduces viewers to the latest crop of the Navy's top pilots, with one of them even asking, "Everyone here is the best there is. Who the hell they're gonna get to teach us?"</p>

        <p>In comes, Cruise's Maverick riding his high-powered Kawasaki Ninja H2R motorcycle. He is back to train and lead the new pilots at the request of Val Kilmer's Admiral Kazansky, aka Iceman. After some clashes among them, Maverick and his crew set out on a mission, which according to Glen Powell's 'Hangman', is "combat on a level no living pilot's ever seen".</p>
        <p>The trailer is loaded with scenes of thrill, drama, suspense and action. It shows plenty of shots of Cruise's Maverick jetting across barren landscapes and over mountain ridges. It also features some pretty spectacular shots.</p>
        <p>Top Gun: Maverick also stars Jennifer Connelly, Lewis Pullman, Charles Parnell, Jay Ellis, Jon Hamm, Ed Harris, Bashir Salahuddin, Danny Ramirez and Monica Barbaro. Joe Kosinski has directed the film, from a script by Peter Craig, Justin Marks and Eric Warren Singer.</p>
        <p>Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the first movie with the late Don Simpson, also produced the upcoming film with Cruise and Skydance CEO David Ellison. Top Gun: Maverick arrives in theatres on May 27.</p>`

        <p>The Tesla CEO says Thursday in documents filed with US securities regulators that he's exploring what's known as a tender offer to buy all of the social media platform's common stock for $54.20 per share in cash. Under a tender offer, Musk, who owns about 9% of Twitter shares, would take his offer directly to other shareholders, bypassing the board.</p>
        <p>But Musk hasn't decided yet whether to do that.The documents say Twitter has not responded to Musk's proposal.Last week, Twitter's board adopted a “poison pill” defence that could make a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive.</p>
        <p>The filing states that “entities related to (Musk) have received commitment letters committing to provide an aggregate of approximately $46.5 billion”. </p>`

        para: `<p>MUMBAI: They never did confirm the date but celebrations for the endlessly discussed Aiia Bhatt-Ranbir Kapoor wedding appeared to have kicked off on Wednesday with friends and family, including father of the bride Mahesh Bhatt and mother of the groom Neetu Kapoor, seen driving into the couple's apartment complex. With no concrete information from either family, it was all about the optics.</p>
        <p>Hordes of media personnel kept vigil outside the Bandra apartment 'Vastu', situated in a usually quiet lane that today was the cynosure of attention with telephoto lens focused closely on occupants behind rolled up car windows. That many of the guests were dressed in yellow and green finery gave credence to speculation that it was the ?haldi' and ?mehendi' ceremony.</p>
        <p>According to Yusuf Ibrahim, Alia's security in-charge, the team has been asked to provide protection for four-five days. "The wedding is indeed happening? The families have started arriving," Ibrahim told PTI without getting into any more details.</p>
        <p>The speculation is that the wedding might happen on Thursday.</p>
        <p>For reporters and photographers tasked with covering the star wedding, the last several days have been akin to piecing together a jigsaw - white curtains used as screens on windows, celeb designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee branded bags going in, stray comments from family and studied silence from Alia and Ranbir.</p>
        <p>Reporters stationed outside the building spotted Neetu Kapoor as well as her daughter Riddhima Kapoor Sahni and granddaughter Samara who arrived together. Ranbir's cousins, actors Kareena Kapoor Khan and Karisma Kapoor, and Aadar and Armaan Jain along with their mother Rima Jain reached shortly after.</p>
        <p>Filmmakers Karan Johar and Ayan Mukerji, the couple's close friends, were also inside.</p>
        <p>A fleet of vans covered in white curtains were seen entering the apartment complex, leading many to speculate that the bride was travelling in one of those vehicles to avoid getting 'papped'.</p>
        <p>Around 3.30 pm, Mahesh Bhatt and Alia's half-sister, actor Pooja Bhatt were photographed reaching the building.</p>
        <p>Apart from a battery of mediapersons outside the residence, and the couple's private security, policemen were deployed for security. ?We have put police security in an attempt to maintain law and order as well as controlling the crowd at the venue, where the wedding of the couple is scheduled," a Mumbai Police official said.</p>
        <p>The couple's security team as well as police personnel present on ground tried to make a clear passage for the guests' cars which were being repeatedly blocked by the paparazzi.</p>
        <p>To prevent any pictures from the wedding getting leaked, red stickers were put on mobile phones of all security staff members stationed at the building to distinguish them from the media.</p>
        <p>An apartment in "Vastu" where the couple lives on different floors was illuminated on Tuesday evening while the Kapoor family's sprawling bungalow in Chembur has also been decked up with flowers and lights.</p>
        <p>For many journalists, particularly women, stationed outside to capture any details they could, it was a harrowing experience - and not just because so few details were forthcoming.</p>
        <p>As morning stretched into evening, several journalists rued the lack of essential facilities, especially washrooms. One good Samaritan living in the building adjacent to 'Vastu' opened the doors of her home so women reporters could use the toilet and offered water to media personnel.</p>
        <p>The day began with Mukerji releasing a ?gift? on Instagram, a teaser of a romantic track from his upcoming movie "Brahmastra", which stars the couple and is produced by Johar. "For Ranbir and for Alia! And... For this sacred journey they are going to embark on soon! Ranbir and Alia... My closest and dearest people in this world... My happy place, and my safe place... Who have added everything to my life... And given themselves completely and selflessly to our movie!</p>
        <p>"We just had to share a piece of their union, from our movie, from our song Kesariya, to celebrate them... As a gift to them, and to everyone," the filmmaker wrote.</p>
        <p>The video ends with a message from the team of "Brahmastra" wishing the couple "all the love and light". Johar, who has produced "Brahmastra" via Dharma Productions, shared the same teaser on his Instagram page.</p>
        <p>"Love is light and I know the amount of light you have brought into each other's and our lives with your love. To new beginnings and more #RanbirKapoor @aliaabhatt #brahmastra," he wrote.</p>
        <p>Neetu Kapoor, on her part, went down memory lane about her own engagement to her late husband and veteran actor Rishi Kapoor. "Fond memories of baisakhi day as we got engaged 43 years back on 13th April 1979," the veteran actor wrote on Instagram.</p>
        <p>As in previous celebrity weddings, when hashtags such as 'Virushka', 'Deepveer' and 'Vickat' became trends, the social media celeb buzz of the day was 'Ranlia' and 'Ralia', a portmanteau of Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt's first names. The two started dating while filming "Brahmastra", which has been in the making for eight years.</p>`

        para: `<p>Los Angeles: 'The Batman' director Matt Reeves released a deleted scene from his superhero film featuring Robert Pattinson's Caped Crusader facing off against his classic nemesis, the Joker, played by Barry Keoghan.</p>
        <p>The scene is available after visiting a website that mimics the word puzzles posed by the Riddler (Paul Dano) in the movie, reports 'Variety'.</p>
        <p>As Reeves explained to 'Variety' in an interview in February, the scene follows Batman's discovery that the Riddler has killed the Gotham City police commissioner, leaving behind another of his cryptic notes addressed to Batman.</p>
        <p>Unnerved by the Riddler's interest in him, Batman decides to seek out insight into what makes the Riddler tick.</p>
        <p>"I thought he would be really insecure about this and he'd probably want to find some way to get into the (Riddler's) mindset, like in 'Manhunter' or 'Mindhunter' -- this idea of profiling somebody, so you can predict his next move," Reeves said.</p>
        <p>The filmmaker liked the idea of suggesting to the audience that Gotham is rife with villains just on the edge of the story, and that Keoghan's Joker is one of the first enemies Batman captures.</p>
        <p>"Almost our anniversary, isn't it?" Joker tells Batman in the scene.</p>
        <p>Reeves shared: "You realise that they have a relationship, and that this guy obviously did something, and Batman somehow got him into Arkham."</p>
        <p>Batman pushes Joker for reasons why Riddler is doing what he's doing, and why he's leaving notes for Batman at all of his crimes.</p>
        <p>"Maybe he's a fan of yours?" Joker says.</p>
        <p>"Or maybe he's got a grudge against you, too. Maybe you're the main course."</p>
        <p>The scene crescendos with Joker taunting Batman with the unsettling truth that there's a part of him that agrees with Riddler's decision to dispatch Gotham leaders who are mired in corruption.</p>
        <p>"I think somewhere, deep down, you're just terrified because you're not sure he's wrong," Joker says, dissolving into cackles.</p>
        <p>In his earlier interview with 'Variety', Reeves went far more in-depth into why he ultimately deleted this scene but kept a follow-up scene a the end of 'The Batman' in which Joker and Riddler connect in adjacent cells in the Arkham State Hospital, and how he developed the Joker's look with Keoghan and make-up artist Michael Marino.</p>`

The beauty of the beaches relaxes you and at the same time the rapids give the best adrenaline rush.</p>
        <p>* Enjoy the festivities and the rains: June brings out the unseen views of beaches - especially Goa - that are usually absent during the summers. The beginning of the monsoon gives relief from the humid climate and a wave of new fresh air.</p>
        <p>* Adventure be your saviour: It is not just about the beauty of the sea, but there is much more beyond that parties and beaches. June is the best time to enjoy for adventure lovers and they can enjoy the different water sports like jet skiing, water skiing, paragliding, scuba diving. Also, the beginners training for scuba diving can best learn in these months.</p>
        <p>* Affordable accommodation: October-January are the months when the tourist traction is huge for beach areas, but from June-September the areas are less occupied and you don't have to spend much on travel and stay. Fares are affordable for luxury resorts and you can book your fairies and adventures at a low cost.</p>`

        para: `<p>Los Angeles: 'The Batman' landed a bigger opening weekend than Warner Bros., the studio behind the comic book adventure, initially expected. The newest superhero epic, starring Robert Pattinson as an exceptionally moody Caped Crusader, collected $134 million in North American theatres over the weekend, above Sunday's estimates of $128.5 million.</p>
        <p>Those ticket sales rank as the best opening of 2022, as well as only the second pandemic-era movie to cross the $100 million mark in a single weekend following aSpider-Man: No Way Home', reports variety.com.</p>
        <p>The reason behind the 4 percent bump in Monday's final tally is because 'The Batman' had a better-than-expected turnout on Sunday, bringing in $34.1 million. That's more than some pandemic-era releases managed to earn in their entire theatrical runs.</p>
        <iframe autoplay;" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u34gHaRiBIU" title="YouTube video player" style="max-width: 560px; width: calc(100% - 2px); display: block; margin: 10px auto; min-width: 226px; padding: 0px;"></iframe>
        <p>The movie pulled in $57 million on Friday -- which includes fan events from Tuesday and Wednesday -- and added another $43.2 million on Saturday. Without much competition until Sony's own comic book adaptation 'Morbius' hits theatres on April 1, "The Batman" should continue to fly high over domestic box office charts.</p>
        <p>Internationally, 'The Batman' captured $124 million from 74 overseas market, pushing its global tally to $258 million.</p>
        <p>Already, the $200 million-budgeted 'The Batman' is shaping up to be a commercial winner for Warner Bros. That's partially because 'The Batman' marks a return to exclusive theatrical releases for Warner Bros., which released its entire 2021 slate simultaneously on HBO Max.</p>
        <p>Going forward, Warner Bros. has announced plans to keep its movies in cinemas for 45 days before putting its new titles on HBO Max.</p>
        <p>'The Batman' also benefitted because tickets at AMC Theatres and other major chains cost $1 to $2 more than other movies playing at the same time. The move, a surprising break from industry tradition, is an attempt for theatre operators to offset stagnant attendance levels as they attempt to claw their way out of pandemic-related wreckage.</p>
        <p>"This is all quite novel in the United States, but actually, AMC has been doing it for years in our European theatres," AMC's CEO Adam Aron said during the company's recent earnings call.</p>
        <p>"Indeed, in Europe, we charge a premium for the best seats in the house, as do just about all other sellers of tickets in other industries - think sports events, concerts and live theatre, for example."</p>
        <p>Directed by Matt Reeves, the PG-13 'The Batman', which clocks in at a taxing three hours, takes a gritty look at Bruce Wayne's earlier days as "the world's greatest detective." In his pursuit of justice, the youthful Dark Knight uncovers corruption in Gotham City while pursuing the maniacal killer known as the Riddler (Paul Dano).</p>
        <p>The star-studded cast includes ZoA Kravitz as Catwoman, Andy Serkis as Batman's butler Alfred Pennyworth, Colin Farrell as the crime-lord known as Penguin and Jeffrey Wright as Gotham City's police chief James Gordon. The movie has been embraced by critics (it holds an 85 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes), as well as audiences (it landed an "A-" CinemaScore).</p>
        <p>"People talk about superhero fatigue, but one of the things that pushes back on that is having different tones within the genre," says Toby Emmerich, chairman of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group. "Matt made an old-fashioned noir detective story. It doesn't feel like a superhero story we've seen."</p>`

        <p>Nope, not the stadium! Nothing there (you can watch the match peacefully). But as per belief, the Feroz Shah Kotla Fort is haunted by Djinns. What's unique about this place is the fact that people pray to these Djinns and write their wishes on a piece of paper, believing that they will come true. The fort isn't very large, and the moment you enter the fort,don't be surprised if you feel an eerie presence.</p>
        <p><b>Bhuli Bhatiyari ka Mahal</b></p>
        <p>Built by Ferozeshah Tughlaq as an inn, the Bhuli Bhatiyari Ka Mahal is now in ruins. The place is believed to be haunted and as per rumours, strange noises are heard here. Ghostly forms have also been reported</p>
        <p><b>The Northern Ridge</b></p>
        <p>One of the scariest places in Delhi, Northern Ridge is near the famous Delhi University. While it is a popular spot for photo shoots, the forest area is also believed to be haunted, owing to its history. The spirit of a colonial-era British Man is rumoured to be hovering here.</p>
        <p><b>Delhi Cantonment Area</b></p>
        <p>Yep, we aren't kidding. All of the Delhi Cantonment Area is rumoured to be haunted. Ghost of a lady clad in a white saree (just like in those spooky movies) is believed to be wandering on the roads. She will ask you for a lift and if you don't stop the vehicle, people say, that the lady will start running along with your vehicle!</p>
        <p><b>Agrasen ki Baoli</b></p>
        <p>This classic monument was built in the mid-14th century by Maharaja Agrasen. The step-well (known as Baoli) has dried out but is rumoured to have compelled many people to jump to death. If you go deeper in the Baoli, the only sound you will hear is of your own footsteps. Rumours are that a strong, eerie presence is felt once you reach a certain depth in the Baoli.</p>`

        <p>Sid Mathur, creator and key advisor for Wai Wai City (quick service restaurant noodle bar) and Chef Manoj Pandey, partner chef at The Piano Man, have rolled out tips:</p>
        <p>* Ingredients like lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and lemon zest can bring out beautiful flavours.</p>
        <p>* Adding nuts like peanuts or almonds adds texture and crunch to a simple bowl of noodles which makes every bite fun.</p>
        <p>* Curried meat or vegetable can bulk up the meal.</p>
        <p>* A quick sauce can be made by blending one fresh tomato with a pinch of pepper, salt to taste and mix in a teaspoon of soya sauce and vinegar. Add it to the water being boiled to cook the noodles and create a new dimension.</p>
        <p>* To give a rounded flavour to your meal, chop and blanch a cup of mixed vegetables like beans, broccoli, peas and carrots. Strain and add to the noodles being cooked when they are half done. Stir till done.</p>
        <p>* Lightly dry roast a tablespoon of sesame seeds and half a cup of shelled peanut. Crush them coarsely. Chop one small onion with a de-seeded chilli and a small bunch of fresh coriander. Mix half the contents in the cooked noodles before serving and sprinkle the rest.</p>`

        <p>The web shop is essentially a unique mix of select Xsolla tools and services that allow users to add virtual currencies and items to their accounts, using their preferred local currency and payment method while offering multilingual display support. The launch of Xsolla Web Shop assumes significance as it comes close on the heels of three recent announcements – the Epic V Apple ruling allowing developers to direct users to other payment systems and bypass the 30% cut of in-app payments procured by Apple, willingness of the tech giant to allow alternative payment methods and South Korea passing a law asking both Apple and Google to open their platforms to alternative gateways.</p>
        <p>Developers can save up to 20% on platform fees even as they can reach out players across more than 250 countries, allowing them to make required payments through at least 700 different gateways. Besides, the developers can utilize API calls to import item catalog to Xsolla to start selling right away. The other benefits include higher retention of local players, online top up capability, secured business ecosystem, built-in influencer marketing and custom brand experience, among others.</p>`

        para: `<p>New Delhi: He has been named the ‘Hottest Chef of America’ by People magazine and has won a Michelin star for his restaurant in New York, but Chef Vikas Khanna's roots remain in India -- and he now wants to take the country's regional cuisines to the world.</p>
        <p>"My focus for the next 10 years will be on regional cuisine. Though it is extremely tough to assimilate all of Indian cuisines under one roof, I am trying my best. I want to bring as much of India as possible to the US," Khanna, 45, told IANS in an interview on the sidelines of an event where he launched Quaker Nutritious Food products.</p>
        <p>Khanna has put Indian gastronomical delights on the world food map and was recently named by Gazette Review in its list of Top 10 Chefs in the World.</p>
        <p>His charm is no secret. From serving food to the Obamas to gifting his book ‘Utsav’ to a host of global personalities, Khanna has immensely contributed to giving Indian culture and delicacies a global identity.</p>
        <p>Twelve handcrafted, gold-gilded, hand-painted copies of ‘Utsav’ were created. They have been presented to world leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former US Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, Britain's Queen Elizabeth, religious leades like the Dalai Lama and Pope Francis and celebrities like Lata Mangeshkar, Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, among others.</p>
        <p>The 12th was to have been presented to Apple founder Steve Jobs, but he died before this could happen. It was auctioned earlier this year and went for a whopping Rs 30 lakh (more than $46,000) that will feed 200,000 under-privileged children in India through the NGO Smile that Khanna supports.</p>
        <p>Talking about his love for regional cuisines, nothing can be more exciting for him than discovering the hidden recipes of the eight north-eastern states.</p>
        <p>"I would love to explore the northeast more. I have travelled extensively in the northeast, even have taken choppers to go to the remote corners of the region to know about their hidden food and recipes. Their way of life has not been touched because of connectivity issues. Things are very pure and natural over there," Khanna explained.</p>
        <p>On his many trips to the northeast he encountered several techniques that cannot be performed in a modern kitchen.</p>
        <p>"I have found how, in places where there is no refrigeration, people are preserving food. For instance, take spinach, add garlic, wrap it in a banana leaf and bury it under the ground. It'll virtually be fresh for ever. The whole of the northeast is home to such natural culinary tricks," he pointed out.</p>
        <p>His love for regional recipes is evident from ‘Utsav’, a magnum opus of 1,200 pages that covers the length and the breadth of the country. The book, which took 12 years to compile, also explores the festivals, ceremonies and rituals that symbolise India.</p>
        <p>"But still it covers only 12 per cent of what we have. The remaining 88 per cent cannot be penned down. You will not get to know them because they are from diverse regions and so many of the recipes have been forgotten," the chef lamented.</p>
        <p>Khanna opened his first restaurant, Junoon, and, in virtually no time, it started attracting praise from every quarter. Junoon has been awarded a Michelin star by the Michelin Guide for six consecutive years since 2011.</p>
        <p>Former US President Bill Clinton once said to him: "Vikas, I hope you will focus on selling culture and not food. Because culture is more important than the food."</p>
        <p>"More than focusing on food, we need to highlight our culture as cuisines are equally a part of it. We are aware of Western dishes because of their marketing. We have so much of beauty and diversity, but we don't push it," Khanna lamented.</p>
        <p>Asked about the trends that would rule the gastronomic world this year, he said it was the Spanish Tapas cuisine for him. And what would be over done? "Punjabi food," was the quick reply.</p>
        <p>Everything else apart, he is also working on a new book.</p>
        <p>"My new book, 'My First Kitchen', is going to be released soon. It is a massive book on how to run your kitchen, how to do parties in your kitchen, how to make cocktails and mocktails, and how to be very , very conscious about your cooking," Khanna said.</p>`

        para: `<p>Panaji: Plastic garbage converted into flotation devices, seaweed strewn on beaches broken down into compost and art installations fabricated from bottle caps and straws littered on Goa's beaches are the showstoppers of a 150-day-old beach cleanliness campaign in Goa.</p>
        <p>The unique beach cleanliness campaign organised by Drishti Marine, a private beach management agency, winds up on Goa's popular Baga beach on April 15, with a jam session using instruments fabricated from garbage articles and a 'Waste Bar', where garbage like straws, cigarette butts, plastic wrappers, bottle caps and paper can be traded for beverages and sun-downers.</p>
        <p>"On land, we can clean up. In the case of oceans, it costs you 100 times more to clean up. Mostly, once anything goes into the ocean, it is there forever. For us to retrieve debris from the oceans costs a fortune and I think we owe it to the oceans to do our bit to keep it clean. That is our tax we have to pay to live here," Drishti Marine Chief Executive Officer Ravi Shankar told IANS.</p>
        <p>The last 150 days have seen a series of efforts as part of the #TeraMeraBeach campaign organised by the agency, to create awareness about garbage and littering, a common phenomenon on Goa's beaches, which attract a bulk of the nearly seven million tourists who visit the state every year.</p>
        <p>"#TeraMeraBeach is participative in nature and uses music as a medium to communicate a message -- be it educational or informative -- in a positive manner. People go back with a light-hearted feeling coupled with a positive message," Shankar said, adding that the campaign's drivers were sustainability, outreach to tourists and organising it at multiple locations.</p>
        <p>Goa is one of the most popular beach tourism destinations in the country, but has been plagued by the garbage menace, especially along coastal areas, which caters to tourism. A concerted effort to keep the beaches clean started a few years ago. However, one of the biggest handicaps vis-a-vis keeping Goa's beaches clean, he said, was ignorance among the tourists about responsible tourism.</p>
        <p>"What we realised was that there is a fair amount of ignorance among the tourists about what is the responsible way that they can conduct themselves on a beach and what we also realised is that they kind of get a little myopic when they are on a holiday. They think a destination is pretty because it's pretty. Now at least they are going back with an awareness that it is also their responsibility to keep it pretty," Shankar said.</p>
        <p>Innovation and tapping the trash and converting it into usable commodities could be the way ahead, Shankar suggested.</p>
        <p>"With beach trash, at the moment what we are experimenting with is to convert seaweed into compost which is a high value item. We are working on an experimental project. They actually sell this product at a premium in the worldwide markets almost at the rate of $20 per kg," he said.</p>
        <p>"The second component is we are converting all the plastic that is coming through the beaches to create swim zones. We are using plastic to create flotation devices. They are then going to be put back into the water to create swim zones. These are the two components which we are presently working on," he added.</p>`
